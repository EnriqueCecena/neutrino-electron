This repository is for the use of the members of the neutrino-electron slack channel.

In here you will find a pre-compiled version of EDEPREADER and the EXAMPLES. This last directory has a file named "EDEPDisplay.cpp" which is the one that creates the images corresponding to a ".root" file obtained in an Energy Deposition Simulation (edep-sim).
